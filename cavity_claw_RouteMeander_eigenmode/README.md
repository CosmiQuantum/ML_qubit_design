# Qubit Design

## Environment setup

Do this first. See the [ENV_SETUP](ENV_SETUP.md) documentation.

## Data setup

Do this second :-) 

See the documentation in the [data](data) directory.

## Quick start

If you have setup the environment and data, then move to the data analysis notebook (`00_`), then the model training (`01_`), etc.

To open your JupyterLab and then the notebooks:

```
conda activate qubit-design-env
jupyter-lab
```
